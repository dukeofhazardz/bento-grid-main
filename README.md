### What I Learned

This project helped me improve my understanding of responsive grid layouts and CSS Grid properties. Hereâ€™s a snippet of how I set up the grid layout:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  height: auto;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: auto auto auto;
  grid-template-areas:
    "box1 box2 box2 box3"
    "box1 box4 box5 box3"
    "box6 box4 box5 box3"
    "box6 box7 box8 box8";
  padding: 20px;
  grid-gap: 20px;
}
```

This approach allowed me to create a visually interesting and responsive layout while maintaining the flexibility to adjust it for smaller screens.

### Continued Development

I plan to continue focusing on advanced CSS layout techniques, particularly for complex grid structures. Additionally, I want to deepen my knowledge of CSS custom properties and explore ways to optimize responsiveness.
